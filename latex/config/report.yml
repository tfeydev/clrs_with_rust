  - id: exercise_2_1_3
    title: "2.1-3 Rewrite INSERTION-SORT to sort the array into monotonically decreasing order instead of increasing."
  
  - id: exercise_2_1_4
    title: "2.1-4 Write pseudocode for a linear-search algorithm that finds x in A[1 : n] or returns NIL if not found. Prove correctness using a loop invariant."
